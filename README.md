Mimetype Analyzer
=================

This basic tool allows you to quickly determine what mimetype your file will appear as. 
Simply deploy the tool locally using docker, and navigate to localhost in your browser.
Then use the file input option to select a file and click submit to "upload" it.
It will then tell you the mimetype of that file.

## Deployment
1. Navigate to the `app/` directory.
1. Run `composer install`
1. Navigate to the `docker/` folder.
1. Run `docker-compose up`
